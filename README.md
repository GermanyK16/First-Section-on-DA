## Structures of Data
we have 3 types of structures of data which are:
- Structure Data
- Unstructured Data
- Semi-structure data

**Structured data:** they are datas that are in a table format

|NAME|GENDER|AGE|MARITAL STATUS|
|----|------|---|-------|
|EKENE|MALE|20|SINGLE|
|JAMES|MALE|21|MARRIED|
|PEACE|FEMALE|23|SINGLE|
|JESSICA|FEMALE|18|MARRIED|


**Unstructured data:** they are media data like audio files, documents e.t.c


**Semi structured data:** they are not in tabular forms, they are seperated by commands like commas (,)
